Experimental combination of various ideas for dimensional reduction nad manifold analysis

Currently (re)implements ideas from following published results:

The ivis algorithm as described in the paper [Structure-preserving visualisation of high dimensional single-cell datasets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45301-0).


The scvis algorith as described in the paper [Interpretable dimensionality reduction of single cell transcriptome data with deep generative models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04368-5)
